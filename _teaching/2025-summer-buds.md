- Provided direct mentorship and professional development guidance to two group facilitators, supporting their leadership growth and facilitation skills throughout the program
- Fostered a supportive, collaborative learning environment that emphasized exploration, equity, and real-world impact, while helping students build confidence in their technical and analytical skills
- Collaborated with program directors and instructional staff to develop workshops, refine project milestones, and adapt programming based on intern needs and feedback
- Served as a bridge between academic instruction and professional development, encouraging interns to see themselves as future leaders in data science and public impact work
- Contributed to the broader mission of BUDS and CDSS to make data science education more inclusive, accessible, and socially conscious
