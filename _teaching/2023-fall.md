__Evaluations__:
- [Andrew Chen (DATA C8 LEC 001 Foundations of Data Science _(EVAL FOR GSI)_) - Fall 2023 Individual Report (Instructor Version)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E9dxXvRNoXIfRy2HeqWnIYaRXPJb5HuK/view?usp=drive_link)
  - _Note_: All 50+ instructors were presented to all 1,200+ students on the course evaluation form, so students not enrolled in my lab sections may have responded with "4-Neutral (neither agree nor disagree)" or "N/A", skewing the results.

__Responsibilities__:
- Led two weekly workshops, dedicated office hours, and individual advising for 70+ Data Scholars from historically underrepresented and nontraditional backgrounds in STEM, creating a close-knit, supportive community for Scholars within the 1,300+ person DATA C8: Foundations of Data Science course
- Organized program planning hours with the course’s lead instructors and the department’s faculty director of pedagogy to redesign the program experience to best suit the needs of Scholars amid several major university policy changes impacting students
- Mentored two group tutors and met with them throughout the semester to discuss effective pedagogy techniques and professional development
