__Evaluations__:
- [Andrew Chen (DATA C8 LEC 001 Foundations of Data Science _(EVAL FOR GSI)_) - Fall 2023 Individual Report (Instructor Version)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E9dxXvRNoXIfRy2HeqWnIYaRXPJb5HuK/view?usp=drive_link)
  - _Note_: All 50+ instructors were presented to all 1,200+ students on the course evaluation form, so students not enrolled in my lab sections may have responded with "N/A" or "4-Neutral (neither agree nor disagree)", skewing the results.
