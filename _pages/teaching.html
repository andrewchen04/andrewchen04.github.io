As an undergraduate student, I was a member of the teaching staff for <a href="http://www.data8.org/">DATA C8: Foundations of Data Science</a>, a 1,500+ person course at UC Berkeley that taught students of all majors and statistics/computer science backgrounds the core concepts of inference and computing while working hands-on with real data. I was also a recipient of the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor (<a href="https://gsi.berkeley.edu/ogsi-recipients-2023-2024/">OGSI</a>) Award in <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/">Data Science</a>.
