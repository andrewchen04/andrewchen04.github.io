Hello! I’m Andrew, a Behavioral Research Specialist at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/)’s [Darden School of Business](https://www.darden.virginia.edu/)’ [Office of Research Services](https://www.darden.virginia.edu/faculty-research/centers-initiatives/research-support-staff). In this role, I support faculty throughout the lifecycle of social science research — from study design and data collection to analysis, project coordination, and the development of research infrastructure. I’m especially energized by work that removes logistical barriers, allowing researchers to focus on generating insights and advancing scientific understanding.

I graduated from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) in 2025 with a double major in [Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) (with [Highest Honors](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-program/academic-opportunities/honors-program)) and [Psychology](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/), along with a minor in [Data Science](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus). Broadly, my interests lie at the intersection of psychology, politics, and data — particularly how identity, social pressure, and information shape political attitudes and behavior. I enjoy examining these questions through experiments and empirical methods.

If you’d like to connect, please feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewchen04/) or [email](mailto:andrew_chen04@berkeley.edu). I’d love to chat!
