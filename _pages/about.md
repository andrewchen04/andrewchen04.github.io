Hello! I'm Andrew, a recent graduate of the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), where I completed a double major in [Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) (with [Highest Honors](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-program/academic-opportunities/honors-program)) and [Psychology](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/), along with a minor in [Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/).

I'm passionate about exploring the intersections between politics, psychology, data, and education. My research interests center on the psychosocial factors that influence public opinion—particularly how bias, social pressure, and misinformation influence political behavior—through both laboratory and field experiments.

As an undergraduate, I was deeply involved in student support and advocacy. I've worked with the Associated Students of the University of California ([ASUC](https://asuc.org/)), the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society ([CDSS](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus)), and the Student Learning Center ([SLC](https://slc.berkeley.edu/)) to help expand access to academic resources and mentorship opportunities.

Please feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewchen04/) or [email](mailto:andrew_chen04@berkeley.edu), I'd love to connect!
