Hello! I'm Andrew, a fourth-year undergraduate pursuing a double major in [Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) and [Psychology](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/) and a minor in [Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). I am passionate about studying the intersections between politics, psychology, data, and education. In particular, I am interested in researching the psychosocial factors that influence public opinion, especially biases, social pressure, and the lack of accurate information, through laboratory and field experiments.

Outside of my own academics and research, I am committed to empowering students to accomplish their personal and academic ambitions by ensuring that all students are well-equipped with the resources they need to succeed through my work with multiple student organizations, the Associated Students of the University of California ([ASUC](https://asuc.org/)), the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society ([CDSS](https://data.berkeley.edu/)), and the Student Learning Center ([SLC](https://slc.berkeley.edu/)) at UC Berkeley.

Please feel free to contact me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewchen04/) or by [email](mailto:andrew_chen04@berkeley.edu)!
